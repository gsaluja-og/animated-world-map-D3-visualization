This JavaScript code, built using D3.js and TopoJSON libraries, visualizes a dataset of active students coming from different countries to the USA on a world map. 

For each country in the dataset, a line is drawn from the country to the United States and a circle is added at the country's location, with both the line and circle sizes reflecting the number of active students. The animated gradient of each line indicates the direction towards the USA, giving a visual representation of the flow of active students from each country.
